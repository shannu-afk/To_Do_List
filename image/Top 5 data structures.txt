Top 5 data structures :
1.Graph
2.stack
3.HashTable/HashMap
4.Binary Tree
5.Heap


Heap:

Heap is a tree based data structure.
it has 2 types that is
1.Max Heap ,2.Min Heap
>Max heap is defined as the root node is the highest value than all node values ,the left child node of root node is greater than its child nodes and lly right side node of root node in greater than its child nodes.
>lly in Min heap ,the root node is the lowest value than all node values ,the left child node of root node is less than its             child nodes and lly right side node of root node in less than its child nodes.
>An array can be converted into heap using the algorithm heapify.
>USE: priority queues ,heap sort algorithm.


Binary Tree:

Binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has atmost 2 childrens3q.
>USE: Database indexing ,sorting algorithms ,Decision tree.
>it is very useful for recursions and Tree Traversal.(eg: Pre-order ,Post-order ,In-order)


Hashtable/HashMap:
Hashmap is a  data structure which help to fast access to the database.
The hash map contains hash function which acts as a mediator between keys and storage.
It takes key as a input and gives index as a output.


Stack:

Stack is a data structure which is a Last in First out process .It is a Linear data structure.
The flow of elements can be moved by "TOP" element.
The elements can be added by using "PUSH" keyword.
The elements can be deleted by using "POP" keyword.
>Adding a elements is know as Enqueue and Deleting a elements is Dequeue.(In Queues....)
>USE :undo/Redo operations ,Function call management.


Graph:

Graph is a  data structure the which contains vertices connected by edges.
If a graph contains directions then it is directed graph else it is undirected graph.
>USE :Depth first search ,Breath first search ,Bus route.
